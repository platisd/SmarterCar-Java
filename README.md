# SmarterCar-Java [WIP]
A JAVA implementation of the Arduino [Smartcar Shield](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield) library, utilizing the [MRAA low level](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/) skeleton IO library to be run on embedded platforms such as [Intel Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html). Developed through a MDE approach using [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/).

This is currently a **work in progress** with the final goal being a JAVA based library, developed through an MDE approach, easily importable to Eclipse and Modelio FOSS tools.
